and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2022-10-07
### Changed
- update the required ruby version from v2.2 to v2.6
- Sugar::Utils.ensure_boolean to consider `0` to be false
- Sugar::Utils.ensure_boolean to ignore whitespace around strings before
  checking if they are 'false'

## [0.6.0] - 2019-05-31
### Added
- SugarUtils::File.append, which is explicitly for appending to a file. It will
  also create a new file if it does not yet exist
- SugarUtils::scrub_encoding, which is used for cleaning badly encoded
  characters out of a string
- SugarUtils::File.change_access, a wrapper for changing ownership and
  permissions of a file
- SugarUtils::File.atomic_write, to atomically write a file
### Removed
- append support in SugarUtils::File.write (could have been specified by { mode: 'a })
### Changed
- :mode and :perm are now aliases for setting permissions on files in all the
  related methods (i.e., .write, .write_json, .touch, .append)
- convert SugarUtils::File.write_json to use .atomic_write

## [0.5.0] - 2018-05-01
### Changed
- bring back :perm as option to set the permissions in SugarUtils::File.write and SugarUtils::File.touch methods
- :mode option in SugarUtils::File.write is now to be used for setting the file mode (e.g. read/write, append, etc). It can still be used for setting the permissions if it is an integer value for backwards compatibility purposes, but this usage has been deprecated.

## [0.4.4] - 2018-01-31
### Changed
- fixed a bug in SugarUtils::File.read_json which it would raise an exception
  instead of returning an empty Hash, when :raise_on_missing was disabled and
  there was an error reading the file

## [0.4.3] - 2017-08-25
### Added
- option to scrub character encoding in SugarUtils::File.read
- option to set mtime in SugarUtils::File.touch

### Changed
